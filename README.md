# Echoes of Nexus

**Echoes of Nexus** is a fast-paced platformer where you manipulate frozen copies of yourself ‚Äî called *Echoes* ‚Äî to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and navigate dangerous environments using a unique energy system called *Nexus*. Created for the [Gamedev.js GameJam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2025), and is open-source!

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- **Nexus Energy** regenerates slowly over time.
- **Echoes** are fully frozen copies but still affected by gravity and explosions.
- If you die, you respawn at your most recent Echo (with a cooldown).
- Strategic management of energy and Echo placement is crucial!

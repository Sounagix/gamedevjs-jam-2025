## Genre
Strategic Autobattler (inspired by Teamfight Tactics, with a classic fantasy setting)

---

## General Concept
A turn-based strategy game where players place units on a board before each automatic combat round. Each unit belongs to a class (Tank, Healer, Mage, or Rogue) and a faction (kingdoms, clans, magical schools, etc.). The goal is to create synergies between units, manage resources, and survive more rounds than your opponents.

## Game Mechanics

### 1. Planning Phase
- Place units on the board.
- Buy units with "gold."
- Combine identical units to level them up.
- Activate synergies by class or faction.

### 2. Combat Phase
- Combat happens automatically.
- Units have attributes (health, attack, speed, etc.).
- Automatic abilities triggered by mana gain.
- Ends when one team has no units left.

### 3. Progression and Elimination
- Each player has a health pool.
- Losing a round causes damage based on remaining enemy units.

---

## Unit Classes

### Tanks
- High health and armor.

### Healers
- Area or single-target healing.
- Low defense, must be protected.

### Mages
- High area damage through abilities.
- Require positioning and mana.

### Rogues

* **Rangers**: Ranged attackers with high attack speed.

* **Assassins**: Reposition at the start of combat to attack the enemy backline.
